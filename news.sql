Back then, the incumbent president, Daniel Moi, wanted to assert his authority even further and so proposed that the university be put up in Eldoret. It happened. And you know why it did.\r\nNairobi University had experienced a number of strikes then, when the likes of the now Siaya Senator James Orengo and former Premier''s aid, Miguna Miguna gave the Moi government sleepless nights. This prompted Moi to propose that Moi University be established away from town (Eldoret) to quash any plans to hold dangerous and uncontrollable strikes like those experienced in the University of Nairobi which is at the heart of the Capital.\r\nTalai, a close friend to the incumbent president, offered him a vast piece of land to establish the proposed institution. And so Moi University found itself in the heart of Kesses, 35 kilometres from Eldoret town. That is a one hour driving distance when using a bus.\r\n							\r\n							'),

"He (Juma) knew a lot. That is why he was being hunted like an antelope. I named eight Mungiki adherents killed in a similar way and (ICC witness) Meshack Yebei. These people were killed by the Kwekwe squad," said Raila. "We can only resolve all such deaths if and when Parliament adopts the TJRC report." Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi rejected suggestions that Britain''s Scotland Yard or America''s FBI be invited to probe the May 5 killing. Instead, Mudavai asked MPs to move a motion to form a select parliamentary committee to investigate the killing.\r\n"For foreign security agents to work in the country, they have to get the blessings of the government of the day, which has already shown lack of commitment in tracing the murderers," he said. CORD co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka said Juma''s family was better off with a private investigator. "Jubilee government killed Juma. Kenya is criminally corrupt and Juma knew a lot of things," said Kalonzo. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang''ula vowed that Juma''s blood was not spilled in vain. "We shall pursue the matter of his death through all constitutionally allowed ways," he said, reading one of Juma''s tweets. But retired Bishop Josiah Were, who led the burial service, asked Kenyans to stop speculating on who killed Juma and give investigators time to do their work. Juma''s cousin and National council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK)''s Kakamega Chair Beneah Salalah wants the businessman''s killers to confess. "The only way to bring a closure to this is by Juma''s killers to publicly confess. We also ask government not to trivialise Juma''s death," said Salalah, who is bishop for Mumias ACK dioceses.

The family also accused the police of trying to orchestrate a cover up in the death of the 45-year-old. Miriam Juma, the slain businessmanâ€™s wife, yesterday dismissed possible explanations offered by police on how her husband met his death. â€œHe always drove himself and he would wait until the roads are clear before he drives home. He normally used Langâ€™ata Road and not Ngong Road,â€ Miriam said. â€œWe talked regularly even on the fateful day. He hadnâ€™t shown signs of being worried. But he had confided in me many times that some people are not happy with him and wanted to eliminate him.â€ Her late husband did not trust the police, she said.\r\nThe narrative provided on the businessmanâ€™s death raised questions, because first, there were no first hand witnesses even though Nairobi residents are notorious for crowding crime scenes. All reconstruction of the murder has so far come from one source, on a day and time when such a scene would have caused a major traffic snarl-up on the road that links the city to the Karen suburb. Police say the shooting occurred around 9:30pm and the body was moved to Karen police station at 11pm. â€œGiven the traffic jam on Ngong Road, some motorists could have witnessed him being killed,â€ said prominent Nairobi businessman Jimmy Wanjigi. Wanjigi, who is Jumaâ€™s brother-in-law and business associate, wondered why police quickly transported the body to City Mortuary before informing anyone. â€œJumaâ€™s phones were working. The police could have called his family or friends to inform them before taking further action. Rushing the body to the mortuary, not cordoning off the area and marking it as a crime scene is suspicious,â€ Wanjigi said. A man who operates a boda boda near the alleged scene also had doubts. â€œMany vehicles pass through this road. It is not possible that they can kill someone here silently without anyone noticing,â€ he said. Security guards near the entrance of Lenana School on duty that night said they did not hear any shooting. A few feet from where the car stopped is a steep valley which family members believe the car ought to have rolled into given that there was a gun fight. Women who tend to tree nurseries by the roadside near the scene said they only learnt of the accident on Friday morning when a few people came to witness what was happening. â€œThe police made no effort to control those coming here. They were only interested in towing the car and the dead man away,â€ said one woman, contradicting police reports that the body was taken to City Mortuary at 11pm Thursday.\r\n					\r\n							'),

Speaking to The Nairobian, Maxwell Odhiambo, the principal at Musaria Secondary School, said that in his 20 yearsâ€™ teaching experience, he would classify B students as more intelligent.\r\n\r\nâ€œI have seen some who start even from certificate level, climb through the ranks and are very successful,â€ said Odhiambo.\r\n\r\nâ€œSome of them struggle through local schools and get a mean grade of â€˜Bâ€™, so it tells a lot,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nGaya adds that when a student gets a â€˜B,â€™ his or her world has not necessarily ended. â€œThese students can start by going for high quality diploma courses before upgrading to a degree after two years.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn fact, those who come to my classes with diploma backgrounds are normally exceptionally good,â€ said Gaya.					\r\n							'),
